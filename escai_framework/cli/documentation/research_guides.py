Agent behavior was monitored using ESCAI's real-time monitoring system, which captures epistemic states, decisions, and tool usage with minimal performance overhead. The monitoring system records all agent actions, internal state changes, and environmental interactions with microsecond-precision timestamps.

### Statistical Analysis

Behavioral patterns were identified using ESCAI's pattern mining algorithms, which implement statistical significance testing with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Causal relationships were analyzed using directed acyclic graph (DAG) inference with bootstrap confidence intervals.

### Session Management

All experimental sessions were managed using ESCAI's session system, ensuring complete reproducibility through automatic capture of experimental parameters, agent configurations, and environmental conditions.
