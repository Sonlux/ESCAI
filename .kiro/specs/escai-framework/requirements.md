# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ESCAI (Epistemic State and Causal Analysis Intelligence) Framework is an observability system designed to monitor autonomous agent cognition in real-time. The system provides deep insights into how AI agents think, decide, and behave during task execution by tracking epistemic states, analyzing behavioral patterns, discovering causal relationships, and predicting performance outcomes. The framework supports multiple agent frameworks including LangChain, AutoGen, CrewAI, and OpenAI Assistants.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want to monitor agent epistemic states in real-time, so that I can understand how agents' beliefs, knowledge, and goals evolve during task execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an agent begins task execution THEN the system SHALL capture initial epistemic state within 100ms
2. WHEN an agent's beliefs, knowledge, or goals change THEN the system SHALL update the epistemic state within 100ms
3. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL maintain less than 10% performance overhead on agent execution
4. IF an epistemic state update fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue monitoring without interruption

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer building autonomous agent systems, I want to integrate monitoring across different agent frameworks, so that I can have consistent observability regardless of the underlying technology.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with LangChain THEN the system SHALL capture chain execution events through callbacks
2. WHEN integrating with AutoGen THEN the system SHALL monitor multi-agent conversation flows
3. WHEN integrating with CrewAI THEN the system SHALL track task delegation and workflow execution
4. WHEN integrating with OpenAI Assistants THEN the system SHALL monitor assistant interactions and tool usage
5. IF a framework API changes THEN the system SHALL continue functioning through abstract interface design

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an operations team member, I want to identify behavioral patterns in agent execution, so that I can optimize performance and detect anomalies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing agent behavior THEN the system SHALL identify at least 10 distinct behavioral patterns per agent type
2. WHEN a new behavioral pattern is detected THEN the system SHALL classify it within 500ms
3. WHEN patterns are analyzed THEN the system SHALL provide success rates and frequency metrics
4. IF an anomalous pattern is detected THEN the system SHALL generate an alert within 200ms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want predictive analytics for agent performance, so that I can forecast task outcomes and intervene before failures occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN predicting task outcomes THEN the system SHALL achieve greater than 85% accuracy
2. WHEN generating predictions THEN the system SHALL provide results within 200ms
3. WHEN a high failure risk is detected THEN the system SHALL alert stakeholders immediately
4. IF prediction confidence is low THEN the system SHALL indicate uncertainty levels to users

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an AI researcher, I want to understand causal relationships in agent decision-making, so that I can analyze why certain decisions lead to specific outcomes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing causal relationships THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within 2 seconds
2. WHEN causal links are discovered THEN the system SHALL provide statistical significance scores
3. WHEN presenting causal relationships THEN the system SHALL include confidence levels and evidence
4. IF causal analysis is inconclusive THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate uncertainty

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time APIs and WebSocket connections, so that I can build custom dashboards and integrate with existing monitoring systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL respond within 500ms
2. WHEN using WebSocket connections THEN the system SHALL support at least 50 concurrent connections
3. WHEN streaming real-time data THEN the system SHALL maintain connection stability with 99.9% uptime
4. IF API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want scalable data storage and processing, so that the system can handle multiple concurrent agents and historical data analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing events THEN the system SHALL handle at least 1,000 events per second
2. WHEN monitoring multiple agents THEN the system SHALL support 100+ concurrent agent sessions
3. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL retain information for 90 days by default
4. IF storage capacity is reached THEN the system SHALL implement data archival policies

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user of the system, I want human-readable explanations of agent behavior, so that I can understand complex decision-making processes without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating explanations THEN the system SHALL provide human-readable descriptions for 90% of behaviors
2. WHEN explaining decisions THEN the system SHALL include context and reasoning chains
3. WHEN presenting insights THEN the system SHALL use natural language that non-technical users can understand
4. IF an explanation cannot be generated THEN the system SHALL indicate why and provide raw data access

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want data protection and access controls, so that sensitive agent execution data remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transmitting data THEN the system SHALL use TLS 1.3 encryption
2. WHEN authenticating users THEN the system SHALL implement JWT tokens with refresh mechanisms
3. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based access control (RBAC)
4. IF PII is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically mask sensitive information
5. WHEN any access occurs THEN the system SHALL log all operations for audit purposes

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want containerized deployment with monitoring, so that I can deploy and maintain the system in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL run in Docker containers with Kubernetes orchestration
2. WHEN scaling THEN the system SHALL support horizontal scaling for API and processing components
3. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL integrate with Prometheus and Grafana
4. IF system components fail THEN the system SHALL implement graceful degradation and recovery
