    "prompt": "A new agent execution log file has been created or updated in the /logs directory. Please analyze this log file to:\n\n1. Extract epistemic states (beliefs, knowledge, goals, confidence levels) from the log content using spaCy and NLTK for natural language processing\n2. Identify behavioral patterns using scikit-learn clustering algorithms on the extracted decision sequences\n3. Perform causal inference analysis using DoWhy and CausalNex to understand decision causality chains\n4. Update the agent's cognitive profile in the Streamlit monitoring dashboard with new insights\n5. Run anomaly detection using open-source algorithms to identify unusual reasoning patterns and generate real-time alerts if needed\n6. Create explanatory summaries of the agent's belief states and confidence evolution\n7. Store all analysis results in the PostgreSQL database for historical tracking\n\nFocus on open-source frameworks like LangChain, AutoGen, and custom agent implementations. Use standardized logging formats and avoid any proprietary integrations. Ensure the analysis provides actionable insights into the agent's cognitive processes and decision-making patterns."
