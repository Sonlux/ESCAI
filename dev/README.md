# Development Directory

This directory contains development artifacts, implementation summaries, and utility files that support the ESCAI Framework development process but are not part of the core framework distribution.

## Directory Structure

### `/docs/`

Contains implementation summaries, progress reports, and development documentation:

- Implementation summaries for each major feature
- MyPy and Flake8 resolution documentation
- Development progress tracking
- Troubleshooting guides and problem logs

### `/tests/`

Contains development test scripts and validation utilities:

- Standalone test scripts for specific features
- Import validation and fix utilities
- Basic functionality verification scripts
- Development-specific test runners

### `/scripts/`

Contains utility scripts for development and maintenance:

- Workflow cleanup utilities
- Code generation and validation scripts
- Development automation tools

### `/exports/`

Contains exported data, reports, and configuration files:

- Test reports and coverage data
- Configuration exports and backups
- MyPy output and analysis results
- Compatibility matrices and validation data

## Purpose

This organization keeps the main repository root clean and professional while preserving all development history and utilities. All files in this directory are maintained for:

1. **Development Reference** - Implementation summaries and progress tracking
2. **Debugging Support** - Problem logs and troubleshooting documentation
3. **Validation Tools** - Test scripts and verification utilities
4. **Historical Record** - Complete development process documentation

## Usage

These files are primarily for developers working on the ESCAI Framework. End users of the framework typically don't need to interact with this directory.

To access development tools:

```bash
# Run development tests
python dev/tests/test_basic_functionality.py

# Use workflow cleanup utility
python dev/scripts/workflow_cleanup.py

# View implementation summaries
ls dev/docs/*_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
```
